# README

Here, we supply the input files for each system used for testing the `slow-rotations` code. 

Each directory contains the simulation start files for each system as well as the GROMACS MDP files and SLURM run scripts
* `hipen`: gas phase NVT simulations of the HiPen dataset
* `mpro`: protein-ligand complex in solvent NPT simulations
* `mcl1`: protein-ligand complex in solvent NPT Separated Topologies binding free energy calculation
